# Fundamental C Revisions

This folder contains a set of fundamental C programming exercises and examples designed to revise and practice essential C programming concepts, including recursion, iteration, array manipulation, switch statements, and basic input/output handling.

| S. No. | Topic | Solution | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | GCD using Recursion | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/1.%20Fundamental%20C%20Revisions/gcd_1.c)| Finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a recursive function. Demonstrates the use of recursion and conditional logic to solve a classic mathematical problem. |
| 2. | GCD using Iteration | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/1.%20Fundamental%20C%20Revisions/gcd_2.c) | Finds the GCD of two numbers using the iterative Euclidean algorithm. Shows how loops can be used to replace recursion for efficiency in certain cases. |
| 3. | Input and Display Name | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/1.%20Fundamental%20C%20Revisions/pb1.c) | A simple program to input and display a string (name). Reinforces basic string input and output using scanf and printf. |
| 4. | Basic Arithmetic Operations with Switch | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/1.%20Fundamental%20C%20Revisions/pb2.c) | Takes two integer inputs and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) based on user choice. Demonstrates the use of a switch-case control structure for multiple operation handling. |
| 5. | Sum of Elements in Arrays with Choice | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/1.%20Fundamental%20C%20Revisions/pb3.c) | Accepts input for two arrays (one of size 5 and another of size 4). Uses a switch statement to let the user choose between summing two elements within the first array, the second array, or one element from each array. Includes index validation and error handling |

## How to Use

1. Compile each C program using a C compiler like `gcc`:

    ```bash
    gcc program_name.c -o program_name
    ```

2. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

3. Follow on-screen prompts for inputs and choices.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand recursion vs iteration through GCD examples.
- Practice array input, indexing, and element-wise operations.
- Implement switch-case control flow for menu-driven programs.
- Handle user input for strings and integers with validation.
