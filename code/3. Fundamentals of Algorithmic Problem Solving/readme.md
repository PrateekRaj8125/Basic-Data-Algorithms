# Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving

This folder contains two programs that practice core algorithmic techniques: number base conversion using iterative division and greatest common divisor computation using the Euclidean algorithm. These help reinforce loop control, arithmetic operations, and problem decomposition.

[Output File](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/3.%20Fundamentals%20of%20Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving/pb1/outBin.dat) | Converts a decimal integer to its binary representation by repeated division by 2 and collecting remainders. Demonstrates iterative logic and output construction. |
| 2. | Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) | [Solution](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/3.%20Fundamentals%20of%20Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving/pb2/pb2.c) . [Input File](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/3.%20Fundamentals%20of%20Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving/pb2/inGCD.dat) . [Output File](https://github.com/PrateekRaj8125/Basic-Data-Algorithms/blob/main/code/3.%20Fundamentals%20of%20Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving/pb2/outGCD.dat) | Computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm (iterative or recursive), illustrating algorithmic efficiency and control flow. |

## How to Use

1. Compile the C programs using a compiler like `gcc`:

    ```bash
    gcc program_name.c -o program_name
    ```

2. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to input data and choices.

## Learning Outcomes

- Implement base conversion from decimal to binary using loops and integer arithmetic.
- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute GCD efficiently.
- Strengthen understanding of control flow, iteration, and basic algorithm design.
